Vector/automated-tests is an automated tests project for vector mobiles applications :
- https://github.com/vector-im/vector-ios
- https://github.com/vector-im/vector-android

The goal is to make regression tests on the GUI using emulator or real devices.
In order to play the tests on the iOS client, a Mac OS environnement with XCode is needed. Mac OS can also play the tests on the Android client.
A Windows environnement will be able to play the tests on Android client only.

The automated tests are performed by using the open-source project Appium licensed under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0. Please refer to http://appium.io/ to set-up your environnement.
Tests are written in JAVA.

You can build the app from source as per below:
